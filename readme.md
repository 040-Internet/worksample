# Work Sample for 040

## What you’ll be doing
You will be creating an application form for a fictitious school. This form will let our school accept applications from companies that want to attend their courses.

## Expectations
We expect you to create this signup flow using PHP and MySQL on the backend and HTML, CSS and JS (if necessary) on the frontend.

You are free to use any frameworks and preprocessors as you wish.

Define a suitable database structure with the following as minimum requirements:

- Each course is available at different dates
- All applications must be saved in a database
- Each application must be able to have multiple participants

The finished work sample should have a readme describing briefly:

- How to get the application up and running
- Any obstacles you've encountered
- Things you'd do differently

## Delivery
We want you to return your work to us in the following way:

- **The code** hosted as a repository on Github under your own profile.
- **A live demo** at a URL where we can view the finished application up and running

When we meet we want you to show us the code and talk about why you've made choices regarding framework, data structure and how you approached the work.

## Resources
Design is available in the design folder of this repository.

The courses are available as json in the endpoints folder.

The font is Source Sans Pro: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro

## If you have time
The following items are not required but if you have the time feel free to implement them. We will review these extras in the same way we review the base work sample.

- **UI/UX:** Consider different ways to polish the form using interactions, animations or adding in anything else you feel is missing or would enrich the user experience.
- **Add views:** Build views (index, individual item) for our schools’s administrators to let them browse the course applications from an interface.
- **Minimize spam:** Consider ways to minimize the number of spam submissions in the form. Explain it in the readme.

## Hints
Don't forget:

- Keep it simple
- Planning is key
- Use GitHub continuously

## Have fun!
This test is not about pointing fingers or say you did something wrong. We want to see how you think and how you implement a common task into code.
